# The (Unofficial) Google Messages Desktop Application

Recently Google released a [web application](https://messages.android.com/) that allows text messages to be sent and received from your phone in tandem from their website.
This project "nativefies" the website into a desktop application. Check out the [releases page](https://github.com/maxchehab/Unofficial-Google-Messages-Desktop-App/releases) for downloads.

</p>

To build localy:

```bash
$ npm install nativefier -g
$ make local
```

Navigate to `dist/`.

This wouldn't be possible without [Jia's](https://github.com/jiahaog) [nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier).
