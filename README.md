# The (Unofficial) Google Messages Desktop Application

Recently Google released a [web application](https://http://messages.android.com/) that allows text messages to be sent and recieved from your phone in tandem from their website.
This project "nativefies" the website into a desktop application. Check out the [releases page]() for downloads.

This wouldn't be possible without [Jia's](https://github.com/jiahaog) [nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier).
